# MonochromeScriptAssembler
A simple script (dis)assembler for Pok√©mon Black and White specialized in precise (dis)assembly.
Re-assembling a previously disassembled file (without editing it) will produce the exact same file as the original.
Currently, only scripts for Black and White (not B2W2) are supported.
